# ELEC548-FinalProject

This project is an implementation in TensorFlow 2 of the path-integration module described in the DeepMind paper: "Vector-based navigation using grid-like representations in artificial agents". Files *.py were utilized to preprocess the raw, randomly generated trajectories. File .ipynb trains the network and displays results.

## Requirements:

1. tensorflow 2.0
2. numpy
3. matplotlib

## Optional Libraries
4. google.colab

## Training data can be downloaded from:
